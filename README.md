# Cathals redis project

Thank you for taking the time to look at my redis project.

I have seperated out each of the sections into their own parts.

[Part1](https://github.com/cathalaherne2/redis/tree/main/Part1) is related to spinning up 2 Redis versions and having replication take place between these servers.

[Part2](https://github.com/cathalaherne2/redis/tree/main/Part2) is related to creating an application which writes 10,000 datapoints and reads them back out to the user in reverse

[Part3](https://github.com/cathalaherne2/redis/tree/main/Part3) discusses the Azure Managed Redis side and what the benefits are over elasticache
